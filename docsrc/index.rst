AQL Documentation
=================

This page is the official documentation for the CloudVision Advanced Query Language (AQL).

The AQL language can be used with Arista's CloudVision to configure dashboards, query data, configure custom event rules, etc.

.. index_quicklearn is for internal use only but sphinx will still be able to build the website without it.
.. It will only be added by jenkins to build the internal documentation
