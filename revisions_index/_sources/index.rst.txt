AQL Documentation Revisions
===========================

.. warning::

    The legacy versions of the documentation are not actively maintained anymore. They are archived to keep examples which use
    solely the features of these older revisions but data paths in examples are more likely to be obsolete on these archived versions.

    The "latest" documentation describes the differences with older revisions when applicable, and is the recommended place to read the
    Language specification and standard library documentation.

* `Latest (Revision 5) <..>`_
* `Revision 4 <../revision4>`_
